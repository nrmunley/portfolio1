       <h3>About</h3>
       <p>The problem-solving skills I learned studying Civil Engineering in college coupled with a creative youth filled with ceramics and architectural design courses have helped me find a balance between data-driven functionality and aesthetically pleasing solutions.</p>
       <p>I first learned of UX design roughly 6 years ago when I was working on the self-driving car project at Google[X], where I was able to play an integral role in a team that led a study on behalf of Google at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. As consultants to the University, we helped set up the testing environment, wrote a user testing script and administered the tests. The experience of both administering and participating in user studies that helped shape design decisions affecting how a self-driving car operator interacts with a self-driving car really led me to start thinking about a career in UX design.</p>
       <p>Through my coursework at Bloc and working on several design projects I have been able to learn and apply design principles which create consistent products and experiences with an emphasis on usability.</p>
       <p>You can apply design principles to almost any problem you are trying to solve or any product you are trying to build. If you are making something that a human will touch, some thought and testing should go into all aspects of the design that the human will interact with, it doesn’t matter if it’s a stove, a washer/dryer, a new banking application or a robot car. With new technologies comes new interactions and all of these interactions should be put to the test to provide the greatest chance for success.
