       <h3>About</h3>
       <p>I have always tried to look at things from different perspectives and to me that is more or less what UX design is. You are looking at things from a great number of different perspectives, compiling that information and designing based on that data. It is essentially data driven problem solving with a creative edge which is why I believe I am well suited for it. The problem solving skills I learned studying Civil Engineering in college coupled with a creative youth speckled with ceramics and architectural design courses provide a good balance between data driven functional solutions and aesthetically pleasing solutions.
       <br><br>My first taste of UX design was when I was working on the self driving car project at Google [X] (now WAYMO). I was able to participate in user studies that helped shape design decisions on how a self driving car operator interacts with a self driving car. I also got to participate in some early studies with Google Glass, another Google [X] project. It was at Google where I really became aware of UX design. From there I volunteered for any user study I could and I was even able to help lead some studies on behalf of Google at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute where we helped write user testing scripts and administer the tests.
       <br><br>These experiences at Google, participating in and administering user tests coupled with a career path in operations, a role that is traditionally reactive drove me to start learning the skills to design my own products and projects. Through my course work at Bloc and working on several design projects I have been able to learn and apply design principles which create consistent products and experiences with an emphasis on usability.
       <br><br>I believe you can apply design principles to almost any problem you are trying to solve or any product you are trying to build. If you are making something that a human will touch, some thought and testing should go into all aspects of the design that the human will interact with, it doesn’t matter if it’s a stove, a washer/dryer, a new banking application or a robot car. With new technologies comes new interactions and all of these interactions should be put to the test to provide the greatest chance for success.
