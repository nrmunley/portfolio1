          <h2>Newlocal's Story</h2>
          <p>It is often hard to find good places to watch English Premier League soccer matches in the USA. The games are on extremely early in the morning and if you don’t have specific television channels then you can’t view the games. There are bars that open early in order for fans to gather and watch the games, but they are often hard to find. This application will help fans find bars that will be televising the game in cities they are unfamiliar with, very much like a finely tailored version of Yelp.</p>

            <p>The goal of the surveys I ran was to understand how people currently use location-based search applications, what the most common location-based search applications are and to find out about location-based search applications that I was unfamiliar with. As well as, the positives and negatives of each. I found that 75% of users tested used Yelp to locate bars and restaurants, but when asked specifically about sports bars there was no common application used. The only trend was that 35% of people surveyed defaulted to Google search when looking for sports bars.</p>

              <p>Despite all six tasks being completed successfully during user testing, putting the mockups in the hands of users led to some design changes.

                  <p>Sticking to a defined process and moving through focused tasks helped to get the project completed in a timely manner. One of the key things I learned was the importance of documenting my work throughout the process to help show all the design decisions that were made.</p>
                  <p>This being the first iOS application that I have designed there was definitely a learning curve regarding the use of the HIG. Additionally, I learned that using real content when possible in design mockups helps get better feedback from usability tests because the testable footprint will appear to be 100% functional. I also learned through design critiques from peers, the importance of maintaining consistency throughout the app, even something small like a tweak in opacity can throw the whole design off leading to distrust in the application company and brand.
